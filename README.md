Thermal-Printer-I2C
===================

Arduino Library for Parallel Printers with Arduno and PFC8574 I/O Expanders
 
This is an Arduino Library to use with Parallel-interfaced Thermal Printers. I used 
a PFC8574 I/O Expander to communicate with the Parallel port. This code should work 
with most parallel port receipt printers that use the ESC/POS Communication mode. 

Place this Thermal_Printer_I2C directory in your Arduino libraries directory, before you 
start the Arduino IDE.
